        Operation Sindoor highlights: 12 civilians and one soldier killed in Pak shelling in J&K’s Poonch; Govt calls all-party meet on May 8
        The Indian Armed Forces on Wednesday (May 7, 2025) launched ‘Operation Sindoor’, hitting terrorist infrastructure in Pakistan and Pakistan-occupied Jammu and Kashmir, a government release read. India exercised its right to act on terror, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said on the launch of military strikes on nine targets in Pakistan and Pakistan Occupied Jammu and Kashmir (POJK) under ‘Operation Sindoor’ while stressing that the actions were “measured, non-escalatory, proportionate, and responsible” and focused on dismantling the terrorist infrastructure and disabling terrorists likely to be sent across to India.

    <h3>
        The strikes on the nine targets, four in Pakistan and five in POJK, were conducted between 01:05Am to 01:30AM on Wednesday. No military establishments were targeted and there have been no reports of collateral damage so far, she said. However, Pakistan has claimed several civilian causalities including women and children.

Operation Sindoor: Commercial flights suspended in northern parts of India
In a statement shortly after the Indian statement, DG ISPR said that all planes of Pakistan Air Force are airborne. “All strikes were made by India from its own airspace. Pakistan will respond to it at a time and place of its own choosing. It will not go unanswered. The temporary pleasure of India will be replaced by enduring grief,” it stated.
